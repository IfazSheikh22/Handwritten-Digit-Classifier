Handwritten Digit Classifier
This is a handwritten digit classifier program implemented in Python using TensorFlow. The program uses the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau.

The program first loads and preprocesses the data, then defines a simple neural network model with one hidden layer. The model is then compiled with the Adam optimizer and the Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function. The model is trained for 5 epochs, and finally, the performance of the model is evaluated on the test data.

To run the program, you need to have Python and TensorFlow installed on your machine. You can then run the program with the following command: python digit_classifier.py
